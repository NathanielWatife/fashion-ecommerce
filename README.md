## Frontend Setup
- Web (React.js)
    - Project Structure:
        Organize components in a modular structure (e.g., components, pages, hooks, utils).
        Maintain a clear directory for CSS files or use CSS Modules for scoped styles.
        Navigation:
            Set up routing with React Router for seamless page navigation.
            Implement protected routes for profile and cart access.
        
        State Management:
            Use Context API or a state management library like Redux for managing cart, user data, and product details.
        
        Form Handling and Validation:
            Utilize libraries like Formik and Yup for forms, such as login and checkout, to simplify validation.
           
- Mobile (React Native)
    Project Structure:
    Organize components similarly to web to ensure consistency.
    Navigation:
        Implement navigation with React Navigation, using stack and tab navigators for user-friendly mobile experience.

        Form Handling:
            Use Formik and Yup for mobile-friendly forms.

        API Calls:
            Handle API requests using axios or fetch, and manage asynchronous calls with async/await syntax.

## Authentication and Security
        JWT Authentication: Secure authentication for user sessions across web and mobile.
        Sensitive Data Handling:
            Use environment variables for sensitive keys.
            Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords) with libraries like bcrypt.

        HTTPS & SSL: 
            Ensure HTTPS for data security in production environments.

        PCI Compliance: Adhere to best practices for secure handling of payment information.


## Testing
- Backend:

    Use Jest and Supertest to test API endpoints.   
    Validate authentication, user profile updates, and product management.
- Frontend:
    Utilize Jest and React Testing Library for component testing.
    Test key components like forms, navigation, and cart actions.

- End-to-End Testing:
    Use Cypress or Detox for comprehensive end-to-end tests, simulating user interactions from start to finish.

## Deployment
- Backend:
    Deploy on cloud platforms like Heroku or DigitalOcean.
    Configure the environment for MongoDB and API keys.

- Web Frontend:
    Deploy on Vercel or Netlify for optimized React applications.
    Set up automatic deployments from the GitHub repository.


- Mobile App:
    Prepare builds for iOS and Android.
    Publish on App Store and Google Play Store, following each platformâ€™s guidelines.
